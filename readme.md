# E-Portfolio: Spring Data JPA
## Getting started
To follow the implementation during the e-portfolio...

...clone the 'Initial Commit' of this repo or

...use the spring initializr (https://start.spring.io/) according to the slide in the presentation

You'll need Maven or Gradle to make everything work! (I'll use Maven. For a different project initialization see the Spring documentation)

## About the Project
This project implements a simple system for storing e-portfolios and students in a H2-Database. An e-portfolio is held by one student (n:1) and several students can listen to it (n:n).
